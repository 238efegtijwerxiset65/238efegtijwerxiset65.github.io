            The referenced material illustrates a particular time frame of the First World War. What we see is a soldier receiving a call to give instructions for their next action. A third soldier, known as a scout, may be seen in the sources' background surveying the area above the wall for any possible enemies. In the background of the photo, you can clearly see that the environment surrounding the soldiers has been damaged by the weapons used within battle.
