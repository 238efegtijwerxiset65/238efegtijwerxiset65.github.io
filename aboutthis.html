          <h2>
            I have a personal interest in radio and was very keen to discover how radio helped in the First World War. In my discovery of radio in World War I, I have learnt that it helped shape the commercial radio industry that we listen to today. The issued I have faced is that it was difficult to find information that I require for this assignment. We also explored and learnt that the U.S government banned commercial radio during the war because they thought it would be misused and it happened the day congress declared war.

            Photographs have depicted the usage of radio technology during the war for communications for vital information and directions which helped shaped the war and how it was fought. The sources that I had to research I found contained little information on my topic, however, the information I did find was very interesting on how radio helped define the First World War and possibly the outcome.

            I built a website by using the markup language HTML (which stands for HyperText Markup Language), and the style sheet language CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets), I used the software Visual Studio Code (which is owned and developed by Microsoft) for the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or in other words, a code editor, I first started by making a main page (the home page) and a stylesheet file (to make it look nice.) I made a bar at the top of the site, with interactive buttons which would take you to other pages which held information on certain photos.

           <h2>
            I want the audience to learn a little more about how radio had an impact on World War I and how the governments research helped the radio industry. I also want them to see the photographs which captured a moment in history with the radio technology that they had at the time. The photographs is a visual link into the past.
