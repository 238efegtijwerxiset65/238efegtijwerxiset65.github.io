            The normal procedures for radio communication today have been impacted by the changes wrought by the usage of radios during the First World War. They are preparing a transmission on a crystal radio set which is seen in the picture (date the photo was taken is unknown.) Today's utilisation of radio technology is quite different because you can have one person around a transmission location rather than a team of two. Because of this, even if the technology is comparable, modern radio employs far more sophisticated techniques.
