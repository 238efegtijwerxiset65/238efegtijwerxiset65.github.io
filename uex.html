          <h2>
            The normal procedures for radio communication today have been impacted by the changes wrought by the usage of radios during World War One. It can be observed in the image that the source is an old Marconi 1.5 kW spark pack with a cart pulling a crystal radio set. (date is unknown) Today's usage of radio technology is quite different because you can have one person around a transmission location rather than a team of two. Because of this, even though the technology is comparable and modern radio employs considerably more sophisticated techniques, crystal radio is still in use today and you can even make your own crystal radio.
